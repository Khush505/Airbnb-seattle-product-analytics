# **Airbnb Seattle Product Analytics**

This project analyzes **Seattle Airbnb open data** to explore how factors like pricing, reviews, and availability impact listing performance. Insights were visualized using **Power BI**, helping stakeholders understand market dynamics and identify opportunities for improvement.


## **Problem Statement**

Seattle's Airbnb market is competitive, and understanding what drives bookings is crucial.  
This project focuses on answering:

- What pricing patterns emerge across neighborhoods and room types?
- How do availability and review scores relate to host success?
- Which hosts and listings perform exceptionally well?


## **Dataset**

The dataset includes three main files:  
- **listings.csv** – property details including prices, host info, and reviews.  
- **calendar.csv** – daily availability and pricing data.  
- **reviews.csv** – customer reviews for listings.

After cleaning and merging, a smaller dataset was created to optimize analysis.

## **Key Analysis**

-  **Price Trends by Neighborhood and Room Type**  
-  **Occupancy Rate Calculation (67.06%)**  
-  **Impact of Review Scores on Bookings**  
-  **Host performance insights**

## **Tools Used**

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning & exploration  
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboard creation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis documentation
